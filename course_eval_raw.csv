I get that there are many instances where they want us to figure things out on our own, which certainly makes sense. However, there are certain assignments that had very vague directions (especially when regarding recipes) that would have been far easier to clarify.

It certainly helps to have coding experience, but what's more important is your logical thinking skills. There are people who have never coded before this class and do great, and there are people who have had extensive coding experience and do terrible. Go to office hours as often as you need; there are always several TAs hosting office hours any day of the week and they can be extremely helpful on discussion questions. My only advice for this course (aside from the typical ""always turn in homework on time"" and ""don't procrastinate"") is to write the recipes first. 

ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST.

ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST.

ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. 

You ALWAYS write the recipe first no matter how tedious or time-consuming it may seem. In the beginning of the semester, it may seem easier to write the code first and model your recipe after the code, but as the programs get more complex your code is going to get messier and messier as you desperately try to patch errors you find during testing until it's a complex abomination that will take hours and hours to debug. You might even have to start over from scratch. Even if it works in the end, you will have no idea why. 

Furthermore, the TAs will not be able to help much if your program is messy. They have a lot of students to get to, especially on the days when there's a deadline, and there's simply not enough time for them to comb through a labyrinth of code to find your mistakes. 

When you write the recipe, you're being forced clearly lay out your thinking in an organized, cohesive manner. With enough practice, you will eventually be able to produce a flawless program from your recipe that runs perfectly the first time. Even if it doesn't, it will almost always be technical errors instead of conceptual ones. Most importantly, you will completely understand what every part of your code does and why each line of code is where it is. 

There is essentially no difference between writing the recipe afterwards and not writing it at all; you're just translating your code into English and math, and you will not gain an ounce of additional understanding of your code.

It may take more time to write a program this way for the earlier, simpler assignments, but eventually you will be much quicker than people who don't do the recipes first because you will need a lot less time to debug (if at all). Don't think you can write the code first earlier in the semester and write the recipes first later in the semester, because this ability to write perfect (or near-perfect) recipes - which is key to not having to debug - can only be developed by practicing your recipe-writing skills with earlier homeworks. 

There's a reason the instructors emphasize the recipes so strongly. To be blunt, if you don't write the recipes first, your potential growth in computational thinking skills from taking this class will be less than half of what it could be, past coding experience or not.

You will find that a lot of past students complain extensively about recipes. Ignore these complaints. It is difficult to recognize how essential recipes are to getting the most out of this class if you do not write the recipe first for every single assignment in which they ask for one. Even if you do, it is only near the end of the semester that you can fully appreciate the benefits of writing the recipes first. Please take these words to heart whenever you feel tempted to write the code first.

I'm going to say it here again: ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST.

I'm going to repeat it again: ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST.

And again: ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST.

ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST.

ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST.

ALWAYS WRITE THE RECIPES FIRST.",688

The course was primarily a repeat chemistry class (for reference I got a 770 on the SAT Subject Test, but not AP Chemistry). I did fine in the course, but here are a few tips. 

1) Get the extra credit. For our year, that was participation in class by Zoom chatting our TAs.

2) Do well on the first exam and the final exam. The first exam's content is very easy if you had high school chemistry. Also, just copy verbatim Dr. Tran and Dr. Kincaid's explanations about the derivations of certain phenomena (ex. how to prove that atoms exist). This idea of verbatim copying is necessary for all three midterms and the final.

3) Go to TA and instructor office hours, especially the class or 2 right before a test. You also need to go to the review problem session.

4) Do well in the lab portion. I know this is for 121, but doing well in the 123 lab portion will help you if you do not do as well on an exam.",185

I came in with little to no experience, and I had to get a tutor to help me. That being said, what you learn intros class is valuable. I'd like to think I'm a better problem-solver, and now I have some experience with coding. While I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for an easy D3 credit, I don't think it's a harm taking the class - if you need something to do and to put time into, this is a good class for that. Just remember, put A LOT of effort into it. 
There were at least 2 sets of office hours every day (with some days even reaching 3x as many) - take advantage of them! Also, pro-tip: go to the office hours early, once you've received the homework assignment for the module (7 modules, 2 wks per module - hence the 7 hw assignments due every other week). The closer you get to the assignment deadline, the less likely you will be to get all the help you need to complete the project. I've had friends sit in office hrs for 2 hrs and not get their question answered - and it wouldn't have been as big of an issue if they had gotten started earlier on the project. So, go to office hours ASAP!
Aside from that, you have a 5-question quiz due before 9 am on the day of class (which corresponds with a set of lecture videos you have to watch), in-class assignments (that you turned-on for completion), and difficult homework assignments due every other Friday (7 in total). There's a rhythm to this class - look back on the videos, quizzes, and in-class assignments especially from the specific module to complete your homework for that module (i.e., look at every video and assignment in module 5 to complete module 5's homework). Once you figure the rhythm out, things will go a lot smoother and you'll start learning and (ideally) working better. 
You also had a midterm and final exams that might easily be the hardest exams I have ever taken (literally, the class average on our midterm was 58. yeah, 58.). Exams are worth a total of 30% of your grade, Homeworks are 40%, quizzes are 10%, and participation is 20%. However, this class is graded holistically, according to what I've heard- they track improvement and grade based on people's specific skills when they enter and exit the course. So, show up to class, work hard, do your best on what you can, and you'll be okay. Additionally, some people dislike Rixner, but I don't think he's a bad teacher. While he can be quite intimidating, he really is just trying to help you learn, and he doesn't mean to take the tone it may sound like he's taking at times. He's a good guy, and just listen to the words he's saying - he's saying it for your benefit.",516

Each TA of the course grades differently, so expect widely different grades on homework, exams, and participation. For example the average on the midterm was a 58 (do not let that scare you), but numerous students after requesting a regrade from the instructors themselves improved their exam scores by over 20 points. A few points is one thing, but a twenty point difference between TA standards and instructor standards, clearly demonstrates a flaw within the structure and grading of the course.

I am very impressed by the range of topics Dr. Stoll was able to cover, and he sparked my interest in a number of IR topics and future careers. That being said, the course was organized very strangely. Dr. Stoll had us read an entire textbook and then lectured on almost en entirely different set of topics (and we were responsible for knowing both on the exam, which was a lot of information). I found both the textbook and lectures very interesting, but I thought it was weird that he separated the class into two different sections. The class could definitely be enhanced by making the textbook readings and lectures more cohesive. Assignment-wise, there were two exams and two reading assignments.

Although I generally enjoyed this class and its material, it is a horribly organized course. Dr. Stoll is not a bad lecturer, but his lectures have very little to do with the course material or the textbook, and about 85% of the time, he is just talking about topics that happen to interest him. Again, those are interesting discussions, but they feel like a waste of time. Even the TA's struggled to connect the course material to the lectures. The tutorials (discussion sections) are very informative - they are based off readings from the textbook, with the TA's basically walking through the chapter. Very few students did the readings, but the TA's did a pretty good job teaching. Because of the terrible organization, exams (one midterm and a final) are difficult to study for, because you're literally studying two entirely separate sets of information, as the exam has separate sections for ""lecture"" and ""tutorial.""

Also, the professor's lectures have very little overlap with the textbook, because he doesn't want to double-up on the material.

Be prepared to discuss only these subjects. Granted, if these are what the professor specializes in, then a level of focus is to be expected. Instead, 11 of the 16 weeks were spent exclusively on sociology of inequality. That feels quite extensive for a class that is meant to cover much more. This would be fine, if this class was marketed as such, but it isn't. Next, the workload was extremely overdone (for a 101 class). 3 papers, 5 long notes assignments, 5 group discussions/assignments, 10 quizzes/exams under stressful conditions, readings every day (to be expected, of course), and a final presentation. (The professor said she was considering altering the amount of quizzes for next time, but this isn't confirmed). This workload wouldn't be so difficult to manage if the deadlines and assignments were predictable. The syllabus was changed several times, but not all of the files on Canvas were, therefore causing several students to follow wrong instructions (and redo the entire, several hour-long assignments).

 Lectures go through PPTs that are posted on Canvas. Dr. Nicolaou is really interesting and engaging, adding videos and activities to her lectures. Taking notes during the lecture is key, as the tests will include things that were discussed during the lecture but not typed out on the slides.
 TESTS:
 Honestly, a breeze. They're all multiple choice, and they are not written to trick you. The correct answers are pretty obvious if you looked over PPTs and lecture notes. I'd say that 3-4 hours of studying could definitely get you an A on a test, as long as you've been going to class.
 HMWK:
 There is none, other than studying for tests! Well, there is a requirement to get 5 SONA hours or write 5 short reviews (for a completion grade) on research articles by the end of the semester, so I suppose, technically, there are 5 hours of homework assigned across the entire semester.

Dr. Nicolaou also drops your lowest test grade. Overall, this is an easy and interesting course!",128

28458,6201ffce53237605118c3f56,PSYC 101,Distribution Group II,202210,pos,"As a PSYC major, I found PSYC 101 to be very interesting, and it definitely confirmed my love for psychology. That being said, it was disheartening to see some people obnoxiously treat this class as a blow-off. During the second midterm, many students chose to cheat; some were caught (since they cheated on the same device they were being tested on), but others were not, having brought a second device to the classroom. It disgusts me how some students will do anything to avoid a little studying. My point is: PSYC 101 is not a class you can completely forget about; if you keep up with the lectures, you will need to study for maybe 2-3 hours the day before the exam (not unreasonable at all!). Additionally, Dr. Nicolaou is a true gem; she is not only forgiving, but also brings lots of personality to this course. Her teaching style is very effective, and in my opinion, if you are debating between PSYC 101 and PSYC 203, PSYC 101 is the way to go. PSYC 101 and PSYC 203 have very similar content, but Dr. Nicolaou's teaching is far superior and actually helps you stay engaged with the material. The only downside is that she can be slightly disorganized. For example, our last test had to be pushed back to finals week (although it was open-everything...) because Dr. Nicolaou had not covered all of the material she needed to. My class never finished all of the content, and the last couple of chapters were extremely rushed. Otherwise, you really cannot go wrong with PSYC 101. Whether you are looking for an easy D2 or are a PSYC major, study a bit and you will do well in this course!",289

Dr. Nicolaou made an effort to break up her lectures with student engagement, opening to discussion, allowing students to share their experiences with the topics we were covering (for instance, when learning about semantic vs episodic memory, allowing students to share memories in order to demonstrate the difference between both types of memory). For each unit we covered, there was a 5 question multiple choice, open note quiz, and there were 4 tests (also multiple choice). The final was dropped. Additionally, each student is allowed to drop their lowest scoring quiz and test. I think this structure helps make the course about learning (and enjoying learning), rather than being too focused on strict grading, which would result in a stressful, and less enjoyable class. I initially took this class for distribution credit, but I learned a lot from this class, and it really sparked my interest in psychology.",160
